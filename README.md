# COSC326-etude4-GraphicalUserInterface

## Description
The project was originally created as an assignment, to visualize a data structure and provide some functionality.
I set out to create something that was both visually appealing(Spaceships), and easy to understand for anyone looking at it.

## Implementation
Using Pixi.js for the visual aspects & vanilla JS for the algorithms and data structure.
The search algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm.
### Features:
Create, deletion, and connection of Nodes
(AND THEY'RE SPACESHIPS)
Animations and sprites were created by hand in Aseprite


## TODO
* Add insertion animation
* Clean up CSS/Add space background
